"""A module's name should end in .py.
To use a module, add a line like
	from mymodule import myfunction
in the begining of a program (say my_program.py). Note that the .py part of
the module name is omitted here.
Then use
	python3 my_program.py
to run this python program. Note that the module name is not needed here."""
